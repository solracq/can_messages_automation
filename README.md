# can_messages_automation
Simple automation framework to validate Contorller Area Network (CAN messages)

A Controller Area Network (CAN) is the nervous system inside vehicles. Every ECU (Electronic Control Unit), brake module, infotainment, etc broadcasts short messages overa a shared bus. 
Testing CAN messages means verifying that messages communication is correct, reliable and safe.

CAN messages contains:
- ID (messages priority)
- Data payload
- Timming (how often appears)

CAN testing goal:
- What is sent
- When is sent
- How systems react

Functional correctness
- Does the right message ID appear?
- Are the signal values encoded/decoded correctly?
- Do ECUs react correctly to received messages

Python tools:
- python-can (CAN iteraction in Python)
- cantools  (decoding/encoding CAN messages based on DBC files)
- pytest
- SocketCAN (create a virtual CAN)
     - sudo modprobe vcan
     - sudo ip link add dev vcan0 type vcan
     - sudo ip link set up vcan0 
- Simulated ECU or message responder

Checking the virtual CAN interface is working:
1) confirm interface exists and is up
   ip -details link show vcan0  -> Look for "state UP" and "link/can"
2) Confirm CAN type    ->  Look for "vcan" / CAN-specific details
   ip -d link show vcan0
3) Live traffic check (sudo apt install can-utils)
   candump vcan0
4) In another terminal, send a test frame:
   cansend vcan0 123#DEADBEEF  -> first terminal: vcan0  123   [4]  DE AD BE EF
If "vcan0" is missing, run : ./scripts/setup_vcan.sh

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run smoke/unit tests:

```bash
pytest
```

3. (Optional) Setup virtual CAN for integration tests:

```bash
./scripts/setup_vcan.sh
RUN_VCAN_TESTS=1 pytest -m integration
```
